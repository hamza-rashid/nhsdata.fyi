                    <small class="small">Well, isn't this a delightful twist? NHS England is suddenly curious if Palantir, their trusted data analytics giant, might have accidentally <b>violated their contract</b>. It seems Palantir forgot to ask for permission before launching a <b>sneaky influencer campaign</b> against the Good Law Project. Leaked emails reveal Palantir's not-so-subtle attempt to tarnish its own reputation, all while NHS England published a heavily redacted contract. But don't worry, NHS England is on the case, even though they just awarded Palantir a Â£330 million contract. Transparency and data handling? Well, those redacted pages tell you everything you need to know.</small>

            <div class="description">
                <small class="small">The NHS's new Federated Data Platform (FDP) is facing concerns over patient data privacy and trust, mainly due to the potential involvement of <b>Palantir</b>, a company with <b>controversial intelligence ties</b>. The British Medical Association highlights issues such as lack of public consultation and the risk of commercial exploitation of sensitive data. Political figures across various parties have also raised <b>trust concerns</b>. For the FDP's success, the NHS needs to ensure transparency, ethical vendor vetting, and public involvement to maintain trust and protect patient privacy.</small>

            <div class="description">
                <small class="small">Despite initial pledges to protect privacy, the UK Biobank has controversially shared sensitive health data of half a million UK citizens with <b>insurance companies</b>. This data was originally donated for <b>medical research</b> but has found its way into the hands of insurance tech firms, raising significant concerns about <b>ethical standards</b> and data privacy. The Biobank, a treasure trove of biomedical data established for disease research, has seemingly reneged on its promises, undermining public trust and prompting scrutiny from data privacy experts and regulators</small>
